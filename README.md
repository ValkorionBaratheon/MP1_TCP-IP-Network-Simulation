# Machine Problem 1: TCP/IP Network Simulation
 This is Machine Problem 1, which simulates delays in a TCP/IP server-client relationship.
## How To Run
1. Open a terminal. 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder. 
3. Input the following command: ``./mp1 [PID]``. PID (process ID) should be a single integer corresponding to the desired process you wish to start (1 or 2).
4. Open a second terminal.
5. Repeat steps 2-3.
6. In each terminal, input the following command: ``send [PID] [message]``. The message can be any string.
