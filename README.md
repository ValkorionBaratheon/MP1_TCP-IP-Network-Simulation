# Machine Problem 1: TCP/IP Network Simulation
This is Machine Problem 1, which simulates delays in a TCP/IP server-client relationship.
   
This program documentation consists of the following sections:
1. Program Design
2. Code Flow
3. How to Run
  
## Program Design
### File Structure
This program consists of two files: 
- ``config.txt``
- ``mp1.go`` (later built into an executable called ``mp1.exe``)
  
### Overview of config.txt
This file contains the minimum and maximum delays (in milliseconds), as well as two processes (at the time of writing), each consisting of a process ID (PID), IP address, and port number.
  
### Overview of mp1.go
This file is responsible for reading the contents of ``config.txt``. With command-line input, it starts processes that constnantly wait for messages to be received from another process. These messages are also generated by user input.

## Code Flow
  
## How To Run
1. Open a terminal. 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder. 
3. Input the following command to build the executable: ``go build mp1.go``.
4. Input the following command: ``./mp1 [PID]``. PID should be a single integer corresponding to the desired process you wish to start (1 or 2).
5. Open a second terminal and navigate to the project folder.
6. Repeat step 4.
7. In each terminal, input the following command: ``send [PID] [message]``. The message can be any string.  
  
*Note: The processes will display send and receive messages with time stamps in their respective terminals.*
