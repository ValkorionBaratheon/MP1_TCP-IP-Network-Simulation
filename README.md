# Machine Problem 1: TCP/IP Network Simulation
 This is Machine Problem 1, which simulates delays in a TCP/IP server-client relationship.
 
## Program Design
  
## Code Flow
  
## How To Run
1. Open a terminal. 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder. 
3. Input the following command to build the executable: ``go build mp1.go``.
4. Input the following command: ``./mp1 [PID]``. PID (process ID) should be a single integer corresponding to the desired process you wish to start (1 or 2).
5. Open a second terminal and navigate to the project folder.
6. Repeat step 4.
7. In each terminal, input the following command: ``send [PID] [message]``. The message can be any string.  
  
*Note: The processes will display send and receive messages with time stamps in their respective terminals.*
